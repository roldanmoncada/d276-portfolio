        <h4 class="prof-exp-title">I aspire to become a software engineer.</h4>
        <p>My professional background has traditionally been in a sales-oriented role. While at my local credit union in Iowa City, Iowa, I was a loan officer which involved selling our financial products to existing and prospective members. The stint at the University of Iowa Hospitals and clinics was my only departure from a sales-oriented position. This was due to my desire to be hands-on with how I helped during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this, however, this professional tangent helped me realize that problem solving in order to provide assistance to people is what truly drives me in a workplace seting. My next role was a Lead Nurse Recruiter at a business that provided in-home nursing services to families with critical pediatric care needs. My desire to be hands-on while helping those in need was met but recruiting is, unfortunately, a sales role regardless. I found myself excelling in the role and being recognized as a top performer but having to sell needy families services that they did not genuinely need did not sit right with me. Then came the technical recruiting job at an international staffing agency. My desire to help the public was replaced due to my passion for technology being reignited. Being a technical recruiter for dozens of Fortune 500 companies exposed me to just about every facet the tech sector. My placements included folks in UX/UI, .NET developers, React specialists, Scrum masters, project managers, QA testers, etc. This also rewawakened my entrepreneurial sense as several of the people I hired also had their own technical side-hustles or full-fledged businesses. </p>
        <p>A perfect storm of motivating factors hit me during this time and I enrolled in a Full Stack Engineering boot camp sponsored by the University of Utah. The program was nine months long and took me from zero experience with anything outside of simple HTML to creating well balanced full stack web applications.
          It was a very intense 3/4 of a year but I excelled while loving every minute of it. My plan at this point in time was to complete my boot camp and try to land simple jobs with local businesses - helping create a basic website, updating outdated back ends, etc. This was to be done while I maintained my full-time position as a technical recruiter which would allow me to have 24/7 access to mid-to-high level indsustry professionals. Unfortunately, things went sideways for me very quickly. 
        </p> 
        <p>I was unfortunately part of the surge of layoffs that hit the tech industry and I was forced to seek employment elsewhere. Thankfully, I was able to join my current team in the Pediatric Pre-Award Office at the University of Utah School of Medicine which afforded me a stable income and provided me the opportunity to once again help those in need by helping advance scientific research.
        For this reason and many more, I am grateful for my current position. My gratitude is handily outweighed by my professional ambition. It would be very easy to sit at this job for over a decade and enjoy the tediously incremental upward mobility that is available as a staff member of the University of Utah. 
        My partner is a highly educated and already well-acccomplished medical student that is only a year and a half away from earnind her MD. My aspirations at this point are not to earn a doctorate like her, but to dedicate myself over the next few years in order to accomplish a higher education and allow myself to have a rewarding professional life at the end of those study-intensive years. This is what led me to WGU.
        
        </p>
        
        <h4 class="prof-exp-title">I understand that my goal requires the knowledge provided by an extensive, accredited course of study, not just a rushed boot camp.</h4>
        <p>My success at the full stack boot camp I completed was definitely earned but I found that I knew how to make things work but I did not entirely understand why they worked. The things I could do could only be done in the exact same way that I had previously done them and any deviation was met with frustration that was not easily surmounted. Over time, due to environmental and mental health factors, I fell out of practice and the information I had digested during the boot camp was all but gone.
          In late 2024 I began to look into graduate programs thanks to my partner, Laura. We found several options but almost all of them assumed a bachelor's in computer science or commensurate hands-on experience. Only after rejection from the University of Utah did I seriously look into WGU's offerings. The accelerated bachelors-to-masters program in software development immediately resonated me. I could earn a second bachelor's degree in my field of interest to give me the background that all graduate programs required. Even better was the fact that I could continue with the same institution and enjoy the comforts of sustained consistency and familiary that would have been available had I chosen to earn a Master's elsewhere. The entire program felt like it was custom made for me - from structure to the learn-at-your-own-pace system to content.
          The hardest part of making progress is taking that first step. Applying and starting this program is now behind me which now allows me to think about the future in a more concrete sense.

          The goals and plans I currently have in mind for my future career can be found in the <em><a href="./career-goals.html"> Career Goals </a></em>section of this website.
        
        <h4 class="prof-exp-title">Truthfully, this has not been a real cover letter because I cannot even pretend to be prepared to apply for a job as a genuine software developer.</h4>
        <p>I also wasn't doing well with trying to create a cover letter to a position that I'm currently qualified for because moving to another position at another company exhausts me even as a concept.
          With this section of my assignment's web page I wanted to take the time to recount my career in the same manner as a cover letter but with more of a storytelling approach so my way of thinking, manner of writing, and so on could be experience by whover is reviewing my work instead of just another cookie-cutter blob of text.
